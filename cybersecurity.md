# 🛡️ Cybersecurity

I am passionate about cybersecurity and actively building skills in security operations, threat detection, automation, and incident response.  
Through hands-on labs, continuous learning, and certifications, I am developing the expertise needed to contribute to modern Security Operations Centers (SOCs).

---

## 🌟 Objective  

I aim to break into the cybersecurity field and contribute as a **Tier 1 SOC Analyst**.  
My focus is on gaining practical skills, mastering security tools, and building automation that improves incident detection and response.  
I document my journey step by step in my [Cybersecurity Learning Series](https://github.com/mwaithakake/cybersecurity-learning-series).

## 📄 Reports & Deliverables  

🚀 **Penetration Testing Report Template**  
As part of my cybersecurity learning journey, I designed a professional penetration testing report template that covers:  

- Executive summary for non-technical audiences  
- Scope, methodology, rules of engagement  
- CVSS v3.1-based risk ratings with color-coded visuals  
- Detailed findings, evidence, and recommendations  

📄 [View Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W_fS2E36BD6OYdq-hEIkniyB1x8q_1Y6S-oFXQtDwD4/edit?usp=sharing)  

🚨 **Uber Penetration Testing Report (Passive Recon Project)**  
This hands-on project involved conducting passive reconnaissance on **Uber**, using open-source intelligence (OSINT) methods while adhering to **ethical standards** and **Uber’s public security guidelines**.

Key highlights:

- Identified employee names, email naming conventions, and exposed assets  
- Mapped Uber's external attack surface using passive tools and Google dorking  
- Followed professional reporting structure and risk communication formats  
- Delivered findings in a formal report similar to industry penetration tests

> 💡 A real-world, regulation-aligned pentest simulation demonstrating practical skills in passive reconnaissance, reporting, and professional documentation.

💡 *More reports will be added soon as I complete additional labs and projects.*
