# 🛡️ Cybersecurity

I am passionate about cybersecurity and actively building hands-on skills in **defensive security, threat detection, incident response,** and system hardening. Through practical labs, continuous learning, and industry certifications, I am developing the expertise needed to contribute to effective security operations and proactive defense strategies in enterprise environments.

## 🌟 Objective  

I aim to break into the cybersecurity field and contribute in hands-on defensive security or Security Administration roles. My focus is on gaining practical skills, mastering security tools, and implementing proactive measures that improve threat detection and system defense.
I document my learning journey step by step in my Cybersecurity Learning Series: https://github.com/mwaithakake/cybersecurity-learning-series

## 📄 Reports & Deliverables  

🚀 **Penetration Testing Report Template**  
As part of my cybersecurity learning journey, I designed a professional penetration testing report template that covers:  

- Executive summary for non-technical audiences  
- Scope, methodology, rules of engagement  
- CVSS v3.1-based risk ratings with color-coded visuals  
- Detailed findings, evidence, and recommendations  

📄 [View Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W_fS2E36BD6OYdq-hEIkniyB1x8q_1Y6S-oFXQtDwD4/edit?usp=sharing)  

🚨 **Uber Penetration Testing Report (Passive Recon Project)**  
This hands-on project involved conducting passive reconnaissance on **Uber**, using open-source intelligence (OSINT) methods while adhering to **ethical standards** and **Uber’s public security guidelines**.

Key highlights:

- Identified employee names, email naming conventions, and exposed assets  
- Mapped Uber's external attack surface using passive tools and Google dorking  
- Followed professional reporting structure and risk communication formats  
- Delivered findings in a formal report similar to industry penetration tests
